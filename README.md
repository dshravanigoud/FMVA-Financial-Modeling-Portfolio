# FMVA-Financial-Modeling-Portfolio
This repository showcases a structured collection of Excel-based financial models and analytical projects designed to demonstrate practical financial analysis, modeling, and business decision-making skills.

The work included here reflects hands-on experience building models from the ground up — focusing on clarity, logical structure, financial accuracy, and business insight rather than just formula mechanics.
