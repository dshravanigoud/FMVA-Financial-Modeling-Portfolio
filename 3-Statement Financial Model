This Excel model builds a fully integrated 3-statement forecast. I created the underlying assumptions and drivers, then projected the Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement over a 5-year horizon. Supporting schedules include working capital, PP&E, and capital structure, which feed directly into the statements. The model also incorporates visualizations of the Income Statement and Cash Flow Statement, enabling quick insights into trends and performance.
